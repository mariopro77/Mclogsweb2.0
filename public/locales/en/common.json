        "subtitle1": "DR CAFTA. Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Central America, and the Dominican Republic.",
        "paragraph1": "DR-CAFTA (Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement), or FTA (Free Trade Agreement between the Dominican Republic, Central America, and the United States of America), is a treaty that seeks to create a free trade zone among the signing countries. It makes permanent the benefits for 80% of Central American products provided by the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), covering a commercial volume of thirty billion dollars. The negotiation, signing, and ratification of the treaty were carried out under differentiated conditions, adapting to the characteristics and political and social context of each participating state; the process began in 2003 for all countries except the Dominican Republic, with the adoption of the text for all involved countries in 2004 and entering into force on different dates for each country starting in 2006. On the other hand, considering that the fundamental branch of the treaty consists of provisions related to commercial treatment, it is relevant to address elements such as tariffs, customs movement, product origin, and internal rules for the traffic of goods. Additionally, CAFTA legislates aspects related to hygienic production and environmental protection, respect for intellectual property rights and public and private investment, as well as all labor legislation in the CAFTA zone states. It also specifies mechanisms to resolve disputes and to establish regulations by mutual agreement.",

        "paragraph2": "The Economic Partnership Agreement – EAE (also known as EPA in English) between the ACP States Forum of the Caribbean (CARIFORO) and the Member States of the European Union was signed on October 15, 2008, and entered into force in the Dominican Republic in January 2009. EAE replaces the unilateral preference scheme that the European Union granted to the Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) bloc under the Cotonou Agreement. EAE does not replace the 1998 Agreement between CARICOM and the Dominican Republic but complements it.",
        "subtitle3": "Central American Free Trade Agreement",
        "paragraph3": "The signatory countries of this Treaty are the Republics of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. In April 1998, the Dominican Republic signed its first major international trade agreement, which came into effect in our country in March 2002. Although the negotiation of this Treaty was conducted at the regional level, its application is bilateral between each country and the Dominican Republic, provided that the goods were produced outside of special regimes. This outlined a clearly accessible market in the short term, strengthening and expanding trade between the Parties, which at the time represented a significant competitive advantage, in accordance with the framework of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) 1994 and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Among the objectives of the Treaty, the interest in stimulating the expansion and multiplicity of trade in goods and services between the Parties is emphasized; as well as mutually eliminating trade obstacles and promoting and protecting foreign investments. For its implementation, the corresponding Ministers of the region agreed in September 2002 to establish the Joint Administration Council, the formation of the 10 planned Committees. In the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, as well as in the CARICOM-Dominican Republic Agreement, products produced in free zones and other special customs regimes are subject to National Treatment (subject to quota and payment of import tariffs), because the incentives granted to these regimes differ across countries. This condition is established in Article 4 of the Protocol to the Free Trade Agreement between Central America and the Dominican Republic of 1998."
